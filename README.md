# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Objective
Within the framework of machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Resources
> Google Colaboratory, TensorFlow, Python, Pandas, SciKitLearn, [charity_data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MRLinares/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/main/Resources/charity_data.csv), Keras

## Results

Given the dataset and the ask of the challenege, it became apparent that the variable 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' would be the target for the model and the variables that would be the features for the model are APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, INCOME_AMT, AND ASK_AMT.
